                        	<p>QLF is an independently-managed business offering not only your run of the mill pipe organ components, but a wide range of custom designed components such as doors and cabinetry. Rocky Mount, the so-called seat of Franklin County, Virginia was a great place to put QLF Custom Pipe Organ Components with mountains and other breathtaking scenery surrounding our 26,000 square foot shop. Our staff is able to assist you in the realization of your next project no matter how large or small. Just give us a call or send us an <a class="email" href="contacts.htm">email</a> to schedule a consultation with our talented design team.</p>

                	<h2 class="title"><span>Our History</span></h2>
                    <p><img src="img/patsmall.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Patrick Quigley" style="float:left; margin:3px 10px 10px 0;">The roots of QLF date back to Durham, England, when Patrick Quigley first began his work with pipe organs at the early age of sixteen. He took on an apprenticeship with the prestigious organ builders Harrison & Harrison in Durham, England in 1966. He worked with them until 1072 when he moved to Canada and began working with Gabriel Kney & Company.</p>
                    <p>In 1979, Patrick decided to move his wife and two children to Houston, Texas where he worked with Visser-Rowland. He worked with them until the early 1990’s when he began his own company called Quigley Designs. </p>
                    <p>After a short time in business, it became clear that there was a much larger market for quality custom parts made here in the United States, so Patrick partnered with Mark Lively (the “L” in QLF) and Paul Fulcher (the “F” in QLF) to build a new, larger facility called QLF Custom Pipe Organ Components, LLC. This larger facility also meant moving out of Texas and to a beautiful area of Virginia. </p>
                    <p>So, in April of 1998, Patrick, Mark, and Paul purchased a ten-acre lot in Rocky Mount, Virginia to build their new 10,000 square foot wood shop on. Shortly after Patrick moved his family to Virginia.</p>
                    <p>QLF is celebrating its 16th anniversary this year. Our team has grown over the years in size and certainly also in experience. Our once 10,000 square foot wood shop has also increased to 26,000 square feet. The added space and facilities enable us to handle a multitude of projects at the same time as we strive to broaden the services we offer and to increase the efficiency in our shop.</p>
